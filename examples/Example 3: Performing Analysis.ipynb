    "# Analysis Framework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataclass structure `Experiment`, `Simulation` and `SimulationTimepoint` help organise and retrieve CHASTE data.  \n",
    "We can manually perform analysis on a `Simulation` or `SimulationTimepoint` by reading its underlying dataframe or numpy arrays, and when developing analysis methods this is often helpful.  \n",
    "The analysis framework class structure is designed to facilitate applying this analysis to many simulations.  \n",
    "This helps organise analysis, allows us to easily define how analysis can be parallelized, and makes it easier to store and retrieve analysis in a database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the general framework is highly flexible, the implemented analysis methods are specific to TCellABM (some methods may not work if a model is too different).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessors\n",
    "`Preprocessor` is a class which can be used to perform quick preliminary analysis on a simulation.  \n",
    "The idea behind `Preprocessor` is that it is extremely quick to run on a simulation and returns a single table (csv) for each simulation where each row is a timestep and each column is an analysis result at that timestep.  \n",
    "This is only used for computing cellcounts in each frame. It is separate from the rest of the analysis framework mostly for legacy reasons, but could also be considered a very quick initial analysis of a parameter sweep, enough to plot cell population trajectories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysers\n",
    "`Analysers` make up the bulk of the analysis framework and the key method is `analyse` which takes as input some combination of `Simulation` and `SimulationTimepoint` and returns some analysis result. Note that the analysis result does not have to be a single number (often it is a `dict` or `Series`).  \n",
    "`Analysers` may be `SimulationAnalyser`s, which analyse an entire `Simulation` (Often this means returning a `DataFrame` where each row is a timestep and each column is some analysis result), or `TimepointAnalyser`s, which analyse single `SimulationTimepoints`.  \n"

    "Most analysis is done by `TimepointAnalysers`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there is only one `SimulationAnalyser` (`MultiTimepointAnalyser`) which applies a given `TimepointAnalyser` to a specified set of timepoints (this allows `TimepointAnalyser` to only worry about analysing a single timepoint, other things e.g. storing the analysis results are handled by `MultiTimepointAnalyser`).  \n",
